            Our Firm <span class="green">design2 LAST</span> is a full service architecture firm specializing in commercial,
            Industrial, and institutional design for both new construction and renovation projects. Our mission is to
            provide design excellence, stewardship of our natural and built environment, and exceptional
            client service. Our philosophy is centered on the premise that design excellence should be reflected in
            each and every aspect of a building: its fit within the community and environment, its function and
            relationship to its users, its physical manifestation, its inner workings, and its cost. We have extensive
            experience working on federal, state and local government projects across the US. We hold current
            licenses in Washington, Alaska, Texas, Nevada and Guam. NCARB certification allows us to easily obtain
            reciprocity in other jurisdictions as project opportunities demand. We are committed to Building
            Information Modeling (BIM) and can provide project files in Revit Architecture or in AutoCAD.

            <strong>Leadership</strong><br>
            Lauri Strauss, AIA, LEED AP, BD&amp;C President CEO, Founder- Lauri founded design2 LAST in
            2012. She shares her enthusiasm, knowledge and expertise in design quality, skills in project
            management, and sustainability goals with new and repeat clients from all across the US. She
            brings to each project over 25 years of professional experience in architecture; managing
            numerous project types for municipal, county, state and federal government clients. Her passion
            for sustainable design began in 1993 when she was pursuing her Master’s degree in
            Architecture. It has led her to design dynamic, high performing and low impact buildings. She
            has established relationships with some of the most influential leaders in the green building
            community. Lauri’s passion for learning and earth-saving idealism led her to pursue and recently
            obtain a second Master’s degree. In 2013 she received a Master of Science in Green Building
            from the San Francisco Institute of Architecture. Lauri was awarded a Fellow of the Cascadia
            Green Building Council in 2012 and continually seeks state of the art sustainable technologies,
            education and information.
