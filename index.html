            Our Firm <span class="green">design2 LAST</span> is a full service architecture firm specializing in commercial,
            Industrial, and institutional design for both new construction and renovation projects. Our mission is to
            provide design excellence, stewardship of our natural and built environment, and exceptional
            client service. Our philosophy is centered on the premise that design excellence should be reflected in
            each and every aspect of a building: its fit within the community and environment, its function and
            relationship to its users, its physical manifestation, its inner workings, and its cost. We have extensive
            experience working on federal, state and local government projects across the US. We hold current
            licenses in Washington, Alaska, Texas, Nevada and Guam. NCARB certification allows us to easily obtain
            reciprocity in other jurisdictions as project opportunities demand. We are committed to Building
            Information Modeling (BIM) and can provide project files in Revit Architecture or in AutoCAD.

              <strong>Leadership</strong><br>
              Lauri Strauss, AIA, LEED AP, BD&amp;C President CEO, Founder- Lauri founded design2 LAST in
              2012. She shares her enthusiasm, knowledge and expertise in design quality, skills in project
              management, and sustainability goals with new and repeat clients from all across the US. She
              brings to each project over 25 years of professional experience in architecture; managing
              numerous project types for municipal, county, state and federal government clients. Her passion
              for sustainable design began in 1993 when she was pursuing her Masterâs degree in
              Architecture. It has led her to design dynamic, high performing and low impact buildings. She
              has established relationships with some of the most influential leaders in the green building
              community. Lauriâs passion for learning and earth-saving idealism led her to pursue and recently
              obtain a second Masterâs degree. In 2013 she received a Master of Science in Green Building
              from the San Francisco Institute of Architecture. Lauri was awarded a Fellow of the Cascadia
              Green Building Council in 2012 and continually seeks state of the art sustainable technologies,
              education and information.

              The new 4000 sf suite includes the Judge's chambers, private restroom, Judgeâs assistantâs office, reception area, galley, conference room, and two law clerk offices. The location of the chambers on the 2nd floor required relocation of the Grand Jury room.  Due to the space limitations of this historic building, this function had to be combined with the Jury Selection as well as the Training Room functions, all in the same room.   design2 LAST came up with three different room layouts to accommodate the three functions, including an innovative custom cabinet to hold a portable ramp, which doubles as a divider wall, between the raised dais and the seating area.<br><br>
              The second floor corridor was restored to its original historic condition including removing carpet and restoring original terrazzo and marble floor finishes, repainting, removing and replacing 2x2 light fixtures with historically correct replicas. The third floor improvements include dividing the library into two spaces; an office and an attorneyâs small conference room. Scope included replacement of the existing mechanical systems, upgrades of the electrical, communication, security and fire alarm systems, plumbing changes, and upgrades of the lighting in the second and third floor areas of work.  Special considerations included historic preservation protocol, extremely sensitive sound isolation and privacy to preserve attorney/client privilege, and adding an ADA accessible toilet to the jury selection room.  This project was completed using Revit to create the second and third floors in 3D modeling.

              design2 LAST was retained by Exotic Metals Forming company to program and plan their new 150,000 s.f. facility in Airway heights.  The project is a new manufacturing facility built near the Spokane Airport.  Project included architectural services to provide scoping, scheduling and budgeting to be included in a Design-Build RFP for the new manufacturing facility.  The DB-RFP document consisted of proposal response requirements, contractor qualifications, pricing format, facility architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, and fire protection scope, conceptual level floor plans and specifications, written clarifications and response to bidder inquiries, addendums to the definition documents, and participation on the source selection board.<br><br>
              The facility includes administration/office space, several conference rooms of varying sizes, employeeâs locker and toilet rooms, large furnace, and acid etch room.  The manufacturing floor had to be especially flexible to accommodate various manufacturing functions at different times of the year.  Electrical requirements included (8) 400 amp Bus Bar and (12) 120/208, 100 amp Bus Bar for continuous electrical power supply at approx. 22â-0â a.f.f, and LED lights with one task light connection point for every two LED fixtures in the shop area.  Water and gas piping were also run overhead with connection points at every 22â o.c. each way for the utmost flexibility.<br><br>
              design2 LAST provided several studies using BIM technology  during the course of the project, one included several renditions of color schemes for the exterior of the building.  Another involved the design of a shade structure to be constructed on the south side of the building outside the employee multipurpose/break room.

              The Warrior in Transition project was developed by the US Army to support their commitment to the rehabilitation and successful transition of wounded, ill, and injured soldiers back to active duty or to Veteran status.  The project at Fort Wainwright includes three buildings; a Barracks, a small Company Operations Facility, and a Soldier and Family Assistance Center. These buildings form a complex that allows wounded or ill soldiers developmental, physical, and social support.<br><br>
              The 19,280 s.f. Barracks was designed as a 32 bed facility divided into 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartments and 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartments.  It also includes a multi-purpose room, laundry room, reception desk and waiting area. The 8,277 s.f. Company Operations Facility (COF) is an office building with a mix of open and private offices for commanders and counselors, conference space, and other support areas.  The third building is a 6886 s.f. Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC) which is a community building with a large welcoming reception area complete with modern gas fireplace at the focal point.  There is also a large kitchen and dining area that can accommodate private receptions.  This building provides soldiers and their families with opportunities for social interaction in addition to family counseling. The project achieved LEED Silver certification.

              The US Armyâs standardization program provided the design team with the plan for this facility, a medium size Mission Training Center at Ft Richardson.  The plan had to be adjusted to include spaces that would address the Alaska climate and the training team that would be using the facility.  The project included the main building, an Access Control booth to secure the front entry, Tactical Operations Center (TOC) Pads for vehicles to connect and participate in the training, and Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS).  This facility supports several different levels of battle command training for soldiers, combat units, and combat service support units.<br><br>
              The project achieved LEED Silver certification.  Bringing daylight into a secure facility is a challenge.  The Army has addressed this by allowing translucent wall systems into the corridors spaces of these facilities.  Another important sustainable feature for this particular project included a high performance mechanical system with heat recovery from the large central data center.  Arctic entries are provided with extensive walk-off mats to reduce the amount of dirt brought into the building by the Troopâs frequent entry and exit from the building.  The project was procured under an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for architectural design, bidding, and CA services.  Bids were obtained from a pool of six MATOC contractors.

            <p>
              Many rural cities in Alaska are large enough to necessitate large aircraft transportation, but too small to warrant a full service airport and air traffic control.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides flight service in these areas consisting of local weather reports, traffic reports, and mapping assistance between villages to general aviation pilots. The FAA owns or leases Flight Service Stations in these cities for this purpose.  At Dillingham, the FSS was established in the 1950âs in the second floor of an old maintenance building.  The FAA procured a task order to replace that facility with a new, stand-alone building.  The client was adamant about achieving a 360 degree view from the operations center of the new facility.<br><br>
              The new building includes a glass enclosed âcontrol tower-esqueâ second floor operations room to allow the operator full view not only of the flight line and runway, but of the nearby harbor where float planes take off and land in the summer.  The facility includes a secure entry, a maintenance shop, a break room, and an equipment data center, all on the lower floor.  The buildingâs exterior finish is durable composite panels and metal siding using a rainscreen design to address the marine climate.  The interior includes exposed glu-lam beams, rubber flooring, and industrial style minimalist design.  This project was conceived, designed, and documented using AutoDesk REVIT (BIM) software. Construction of the project was complete in summer of 2013.

              This 48,500 SF replacement school serves 400 students in Bethel, Alaska.  The plan is a âYâ shaped design and is intended to make supervision easy by few teachers. The entry is in the center and leads directly to the gymnasium, library and administration wing.  The gym can be separated from the rest of the building for use by the community for functions after school hours.  The Libraryâs large picture windows face the east, where on clear days, the Kilbuck mountain range is visible.  Each of the two classroom wings is designed such that additional classrooms can be easily added to the end if more space is needed in the future.<br><br>
              This school includes a large cafeteria that can seat 200 on picnic style tables and full service kitchen.  This building houses the only full service kitchen on the multi-building K-12 school campus.  The kitchen includes a walk-in cooler/freezer, and a large walk-in dry storage room.  The cafeteria has large windows that open on to the south-facing playground.<br><br>
              When the project bid under budget, the school district increased the scope of the kitchen from a warming kitchen to a full service kitchen, and added four additional classrooms to one of the wings by change order during construction.  Although this project did not seek LEED certification, it did include natural daylight and ventilation in the classrooms, clerestory windows to bring light into the corridor, durable metal siding, and structural insulated panel construction to maximize insulation in the walls and roof.  The facility is constructed on a new lot near the administration and high school buildings and includes a gravel parking lot and access road, two basketball decks, two playdecks for different age groups, and a bus drop-off lane near the cafeteria.  The entire education complex includes several smaller classroom structures and shared utility resources.

              Work included eight new sites for the Clark County School District in and around Las Vegas, Nevada.  Schools were all developed for 600 students, approximately $4-$6 million each, 60,000 s.f.  One prototype was developed by collaboration of three design firms, who each then were given six schools to put out for bidding, and were constructed over the course of a school year.  Prototypes were used due to the rapid increase in student population in each school year.  This allowed eighteen schools to be designed and constructed in the same amount of time it would have taken to design and build one.  Projects were designed and built between the school years of 1997 and 1999.

              design2 LAST was retained to masterplan improvements to be completed by the chapel over the course of the next two years.  We worked with the chapel board to identify seven distinct small scopes of work that could be completed one at a time or several at the same time.  Once these scopes were determined, we worked with a local contractor to complete a R.O.M. Cost Estimate for each scope.  This information was turned over to the chapel and guided them in determining the first phase of construction and fund-raising efforts.  In addition to this list, we also created a rendering of the new front entry using a 3-dimensional model created in BIM (Autodesk REVIT), to aid the chapel in their funding campaign.  We provided construction documents and permitting services for this project.  The first phase includes reconfiguring the interior spaces to provide an enlarged narthex, a new nursery classroom, and a new entry in the back. To achieve this, two load bearing walls had to be removed and reconstructed using posts and beams to enlarge the openings.  Project was master planned to be accomplished in three phases, the enlarged interior being the first phase.  The second and third phases entailed replacing exterior siding and building a new entry with a canopy cover.  The first phase was completed in 2015.

              This project included improvements to turn a warehouse storage facility into an indoor baseball training facility. The project included complete reconfiguration of the two existing toilet rooms providing all new fixtures, weight room, office, two bullpen pitching lanes, and two batting cages with moveable enclosure netting. The project included work to bring it up to current building codes, Life Safety codes, and 2010 ADA accessibility code, which included adding two ADA parking spaces to the existing parking lot. Project was completed in November 2013.

              This two-story courthouse by-passed the Texas Historic Commissionâs $150 million grant program in order to expedite construction.  The project included new mechanical and electrical systems, new and restored finishes, restoration of the second floor courtroom, and exterior finish restoration to its historical, 1936 Art Deco style.  Innovative magnetic storm-type window sashes were added to the interior of each window to increase energy efficiency of the original single pane windows without compromising the historical significance and structure of the steel framed windows.  The pink Texas marble used in the toilet rooms is no longer mined and therefore not available.  New partition layouts were carefully designed to meet accessibility codes by reusing and relocating the existing marble slabs in the public spaces.  Prior to beginning the restoration, asbestos ceiling tiles, floor tiles and insulation were abated, and lead paint on the original steel windows was encapsulated to preserve the original construction.

We provided a concept design package for the organization to present to the Port of Everett in an effort to identify a site for the new facility.  The facility will include lab space, an x-ray room, a necropsy room, exam rooms, an indoor/outdoor aviary, office and break room space for employees and volunteers, a display and gift shop area for the public, and classroom space for local school learning trips.  The site will include a fenced area with 10 pools of varying sizes and depths to accommodate the variety of marine life anticipated.  The public will have the privilege of viewing the pool area via outdoor walk through an interpretive display around the building.  The facility will be designed using the most stringent sustainable design principles.  Fundraising efforts are ongoing.

              <strong>Turning ideas and visions into an action plan is what we do best.</strong> The key to a successful project often depends on what happens in its earliest phase. Before any work commences, there is an idea, a vision. For years, we have taken many ideas and created plans of action to make the projects real. Throughout the project planning and development phase, we apply our knowledge, procurement, and construction experience to deliver smart and sustainable projects. No matter its size, complexity, or location, we know what it takes to get the job done and done well.
