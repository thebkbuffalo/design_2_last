          <h5 class="public_txt" style="display:none; padding: 1em 3em">
            The new 4000 sf suite includes the Judge's chambers, private restroom, Judge’s
            assistant’s office, reception area, galley, conference room, and two law clerk
            offices. The location of the chambers on the 2nd floor required relocation of the
            Grand Jury room. Due to the space limitations of this historic building, this
            function had to be combined with the Jury Selection as well as the Training Room
            functions, all in the same room. design2 LAST came up with three different room
            layouts to accommodate the three functions, including an innovative custom
            cabinet to hold a portable ramp, which doubles as a divider wall, between the
            raised dais and the seating area.
            The second floor corridor was restored to its original historic condition including
            removing carpet and restoring original terrazzo and marble floor finishes,
            repainting, removing and replacing 2x2 light fixtures with historically correct
            replicas. The third floor improvements include dividing the library into two spaces;
            an office and an attorney’s small conference room. Scope included replacement of
            the existing mechanical systems, upgrades of the electrical, communication,
            security and fire alarm systems, plumbing changes, and upgrades of the lighting in
            the second and third floor areas of work. Special considerations included historic
            preservation protocol, extremely sensitive sound isolation and privacy to preserve
            attorney/client privilege, and adding an ADA accessible toilet to the jury selection
            room. This project was completed using Revit to create the second and third floors
            in 3D modeling.
